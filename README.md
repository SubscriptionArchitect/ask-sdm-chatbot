# Ask SDM Chatbot Embed

This repository contains the JavaScript file used to embed the **Ask SDM Chatbot** on external pages. The script dynamically injects a branded chatbot UI (HTML + CSS + JS) after a short delay, with zero impact to site performance or analytics tracking (e.g., Olytics).

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

After a 4-second delay, the script:

* Injects a fully styled chatbot interface
* Adds typewriter-style greeting animation
* Allows users to ask security & integration industry questions
* Redirects to the Ask SDM landing page with the userâ€™s query

---

## âœ… How to Use

1. **Add a placeholder `div` where the chatbot should appear:**

```html
<div id="askSdmPlaceholder"></div>
```

2. **Add the script to your page:**

```html
<script src="https://subscriptionarchitect.github.io/ask-sdm-chatbot/ASK-SDM-CB-SCRIPT.JS" defer></script>
```

Thatâ€™s it â€” the chatbot will appear 4 seconds after the page loads.

## ðŸ§  Why This Script?

* âœ… Fully self-contained (no external dependencies)
* âœ… Hosted via GitHub Pages with correct MIME type
* âœ… Safe for metered environments â€” does not block Olytics
* âœ… Mobile-friendly with responsive layout
* âœ… Custom branded for SDM Magazine + Napco

---

## ðŸ”§ Options & Customization

Want to change how or when the chatbot loads?

* **Change the delay**: edit the `setTimeout(..., 4000)` line
* **Trigger on scroll instead**: replace the timeout with an IntersectionObserver
* **Only show once per session**: wrap in a `localStorage` check

Feel free to fork or open an issue for enhancements.
